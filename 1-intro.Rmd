# Introduction

Writing is a common task for all scholars and students in academia, which takes a great deal of time. However, much of the time spent *isn't realated to the content or the idea the author wishes to convey* but the chores regarding repetive works such as manually combining results from differnt analysis tools or formatting the papers to suit the requirements of paper submission.

Currently, two document preparation systems, *Microsoft Word* and *LaTeX*, predominate in academia. There are advantages and disadvantages related to both softwares. *Microsoft Word* has an intuitive user interface and hence is more error-proof regarding typos compared to *LaTeX*. *LaTeX*, on the other hand, excels at writing complex mathematical equations and has extreme flexibilty regarding typesetting. The flexibility comes at a price, however. To achieve this flexibility, *LaTeX* has an extremly complex syntax and has been shown to hinder document writing [@knauff2014].

One feature that *Microsoft Word* and *LaTeX* both lack is the ability to integrate with tasks other than document writing itself. For example, in the context of scientific authoring, computed results from analyses of data need to be copy-and-pasted from a statistical software into the document. This could take the author a substantial of time if the anlysis need to be redone, such as when data are updated or some errors where found in the analysis. This also makes the written document unreliable, since errors may be incurred by manual copy-and-pasting the results into the document. A workflow of scientific authoring using *Microsoft Word* may resemble the one shown in figure \@ref(fig:bad-flow).

(ref:caption-badflow) A common but not integrated workflow [@munzert2014, pp xviii].

```{r bad-flow, out.width="40%" ,fig.cap="(ref:caption-badflow)"}

```

A reproducible and integrated workflow for scientific authoring, from data cleaning and analysis to document writing and generation, can be established using R and *R Markdown*. *R Markdown* has the capability of embedding executable R code, which automatically generates computed results, into the document. Hence, a document written with *R Markdown* is *dynamic*. It gets updated every time when regenerated. R's extensibility also makes other tasks, such as typesetting, easier, and it also enables *R Markdown* to be customized to fit specific needs in a particular field.

This article surveys the *R Markdown* *ecosystem* and try to illustrate the potential of using *R Markdown* to construct an integrated, reproducibility-facilitating, and user-friendly document writing environment for students and researchers in Linguitics.
