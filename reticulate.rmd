## R Markdown

```{python}
x = 1
for i in range(1, 10):
    x += 1
```


```{python}
print(x)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
